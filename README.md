by using this app you can find and simulate center of mass point by adding numbers of objects you need after that you can see the red flashing object(center of mass fo all objects) response the changing xy coordinate for all objects by changing place itself using to way : 1- changing place for any object by touch it and drag&drop
2-by click auto distribution button

Features:
*easy to use
*interactivity between user and objects on stage
*simulate the center of mass object on stage
*objects properties : a table contains coordinate for all objects this table for user he want to calculate (xcm , ycm)manually and verifying the center of mass xy(xcm,ycm)
*drag&drop:with this property touch down any object and move it and see what happen for center of mass object place
*play Center Of Mass Finder game : this game is sweety game for all public user and student who want to develop his thinking
